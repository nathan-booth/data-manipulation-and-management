# Consumer Complaints

This [data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/#download-the-data) is pulled from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website.

You can get a smaller subset of the data [here](http://www.superdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ConsumerComplaints.csv). I first learned about this dataset by taking a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/sqldatabases/) course.
