# Normalization Example

This is an example of the normalization process on some online transaction processing (OLTP) data.

It has several components.
* Raw data: raw_oltp.csv
* Importing and normalization: SQL files beginning with numbers (0 - 3)
* Normalized data: CSVs beginning with `output_`
* Questions and answers: MD files `questions` and `answers`

Data pulled from a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/sqldatabases/).
